1
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,051
You@It should be fixed now, right?

3
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:24,891
You@Alright, we've got water now.

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,093
Shirley@Not bad at all.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,295
Shirley@A rich heir actually fixing the bathroom with his own hands.

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,166
You@I'm sorry about that.

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,468
You@For making you all put up with this broken bathroom for so long.

10
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,038
Shirley@At least you have a conscience.

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:38,972
Shirley@Otherwise...

12
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,441
You@Otherwise what?

13
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,076
Shirley@Otherwise, I might have started looking for a new place to live.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,748
You@The company's a bit tight on money lately.

16
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,282
You@When things get better,

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,752
You@I'll definitely buy you all a dryer to make up for it.

19
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:55,722
Shirley@Alright, alright.

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,024
Shirley@I know you've been working hard lately.

21
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:58,958
Shirley@Here,

22
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,593
Shirley@Let me wipe off your sweat.

24
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,264
You@Thank you.

25
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,301
Shirley@Since you fixed the bathroom for us,

27
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,605
Shirley@I'll make you a cup of coffee.

28
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,274
You@Sure, that'd be great.

29
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,377
You@I'll go change my clothes.

30
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,078
You@Give me a moment.

31
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:19,212
Shirley@Okay.

32
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,820
Shirley@Your coffee, no sugar.

33
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:30,957
You@Thank you.

34
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:33,626
Shirley@What's wrong?

35
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,629
Shirley@Are you still thinking about work?

36
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:37,931
You@Yeah,

37
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,932
You@All the waiters at the bar have quit recently.

39
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,470
You@If we can't find new staff soon, we might have to close down.

40
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,274
Shirley@That sounds tough.

41
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:53,213
Shirley@I had no idea you were going through so much lately.

42
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,381
Shirley@If I'd known, I wouldn't have caused trouble with renting out your room.

46
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,222
You@Oh, you dare bring that up?

47
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,491
You@Even people coming to view the room have decreased recently.

48
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,993
You@It feels like it's getting harder to rent it out.

49
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,095
Shirley@I'm sorry about that.

50
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,063
Shirley@How about I try to find some other people to come?

52
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,968
You@Of course, that'd be great.

53
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,603
You@The more, the better.

54
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,438
You@Speaking of which,

55
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,373
You@Have you chatted with Regina recently?

56
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,509
You@She's been acting a bit strange.

57
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:23,676
Shirley@Strange how?

58
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,613
You@It's been a bit hot lately, right?

59
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,116
You@So I came to check if there were any problems in the dorm.

60
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,518
You@But I saw her downstairs wearing a large coat and acting all sneaky.

63
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,991
You@Like she was afraid of me seeing her.

64
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:39,993
Shirley@Oh, yeah.

65
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,729
Shirley@I've seen her going out at night wearing a big coat recently.

67
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,567
Shirley@Maybe she's got a boyfriend?

68
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,402
You@That's possible.

69
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,338
You@She seems like the type who'd completely change when she gets a boyfriend.

70
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,441
Shirley@Alright, let's not worry about her.

71
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,577
Shirley@I'm going to livestream tonight to sell some clothes I designed.

73
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,449
Shirley@Want to help me out?

74
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,218
Shirley@I could use an assistant.
